        			<p><a href="https://www.w3schools.com/"><span style="color: #009933;font-weight: bold;">W3schools</span></a> is one of the most popular website of our generation for online tutoring and gaining extra knowledge about programming langauge. It has course of almost all language like Java, Python, CSS, JavaScript, C++, C#, SQL and many more. I frequently visit this website so iam very fond of this one. I got ideas about navigation bars, color combinations for my website, logo, its positioning and font styling which i took as reference from this one. This website is way more advance, more responsive and has many decorations then mine like navigation bar menu dropdown, search icon and many more. Comparing it to my website, in my website navigation bar, there is no search button or any dropdown function in nav bar menu. Some similar parts are the nav bar itself, not the exact same but look alike type font style and logo placement.</p>

        			<!--inserting link to the word facebook in below paragraph -->
                    <p>Right now, the most popular social media in the whole world is without a doubt <a href="https://www.facebook.com/"><span style="color: #3399ff; font-weight: bold;"> facebook</span></a>. It is everywhere and everyone uses it. I logged into it daily to remain updated with this never stopping world. It allows me to do activities with my friends like messaging, calling, video calling, posting status or even sharing media with them. And whenever i logged in there is this above shown login page which i get to see everyday. And as i was learning html, i was very eager to learn how can i make that type of login page. So when this coursework was given, i decided to take reference for my login page from here. I have tried to make it look same as much as possible like keeping the logo on left side while my login form on right side and create a new account section in case if the user has no account. But in case of reponsiveness, login page of <a href="https://www.facebook.com/"><span style="color: #3399ff; font-weight: bold;">facebook</span></a> takes the long lead. My login page will not even know if the user already has a account or not. So, Comparing to it, only my designs are similar.</p>

                    <p><a href="https://medium.com/"><span style="color: #ffcc00; font-weight: bold;">Medium</span></a> is a website for readers and writers. Here, ideas take shape, take off and spark powerful conversations. There are many articels, blogs written by individuals from around the globe. Above shown webpage is one of the many articles in this website. I also have blog and research section in my website where i wanted to explain things like in articles and i didn't had the proper way to implement it and i was searching for ideas and i found this webiste. It was perfect as i was looking for. So, i took reference for my blog and research section from here. Comparing to it, i could meet most of the parts because it only required well adjusted photos and paragraphs. </p>

I have also used it to buy some of the parts for my laptop and to check prize and updates about devices. As this is also one of my frequently visiting sites, its home page caught my eyes. I have taken reference for my home page from this website. Comparing to it, my nav bar and logo position in nav bar is almost same except the search bar in above shown image. In place of BUY NOW button in this webpage, i have login and signup buttons in mine. Most of the section including button positioning, background image and heading seems similar.</p>

It allows user to create HTML5 websites and mobile sites through the use of online drag and drop tools. I have also taken reference for my home page from above webpages and this website home page is also one of them. I wanted my home page which is probably the first page to be perfect so i had to look at many webpages before actually start making it. And this website has the professionalism which i was searching for my website. Comparing, more light type of colors are used and has more functions. Whereas, i've choosen a lot darker theme by using darker colors. </p>
